Uniform supercardioid pattern for high gain-before-feedback and superior rejection of off–axis sound

Hardened steel mesh grille that facilitates use of proximity effect and resists wear and abuse

Neodymium magnet for high signal–to–noise ratio output

Minimally affected by varying load impedance

Advanced pneumatic shock mount system that minimizes transmission of mechanical noise and vibration

 The Beta 58A has increased sensitivity and high-end frequency response which results in a cleaner more detailed sound. It also features a supercardioid polar pattern compared to the SM58’s cardioid, giving it greater unwanted sound rejection and more resistance to feedback.",,,,,,,,
1898.0,834.0,SHURE BETA 91A,Audio - Microphones,"The Beta 91A is a half cardioid condenser boundary microphone. You can expect a strong low end response as it is specifically tailored for bass frequency applications, and superior attack and punch for studio quality sound even at extremely high sound pressure levels (SPL). 

Uniform half-cardioid polar pattern for maximum gain-before-feedback and rejection of off-axis sound

Precision-engineered low-profile design features integrated preamplifier and XLR connector to maximize setup efficiency while minimizing stage clutter

Frequency response tailored for kick drum/low frequency applications with a wide dynamic range for use in high SPL environments

Two-position contour switch to maximize attack and clarity depending on application – select the flat response setting for natural sound in most applications or the “low-mid scoop” setting for a strong low frequency “punch” with plenty of higher frequency attack

It includes a wide variety of built-in Lexicon studio-grade reverb, chorus, modulation and other effects and dbx limiters on the input channels.

LD MAUI 28 - the compact, active and modular ""all-in-one"" system

The LD MAUI 28 (Multiple Array User Intuitive) is the perfect solution for musicians and DJs as well as presentations and events with sophisticated music playback.

Because no cables and stands are required, this “plug-and-play” system can be set up and taken down again very easily and quickly. Frequency-response-based 4.1 five-way amping results in a clear, dynamic and balanced sound throughout the frequency range of this system. The array configuration ensures greater coverage with very well-balanced sound distribution even in the farthest corners of the venue.

The MAUI 28, which combines PA and monitoring system in one, guarantees the same sound experience for both audience and musician. No disturbing speaker cables, no speaker stands, no transport issues, simply plug in the mixer and you're ready to go.
