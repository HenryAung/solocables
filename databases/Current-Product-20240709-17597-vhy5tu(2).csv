LD MAUI 28 - the compact, active and modular ""all-in-one"" system

The LD MAUI 28 (Multiple Array User Intuitive) is the perfect solution for musicians and DJs as well as presentations and events with sophisticated music playback.

Because no cables and stands are required, this “plug-and-play” system can be set up and taken down again very easily and quickly. Frequency-response-based 4.1 five-way amping results in a clear, dynamic and balanced sound throughout the frequency range of this system. The array configuration ensures greater coverage with very well-balanced sound distribution even in the farthest corners of the venue.

The MAUI 28, which combines PA and monitoring system in one, guarantees the same sound experience for both audience and musician. No disturbing speaker cables, no speaker stands, no transport issues, simply plug in the mixer and you're ready to go.

The horn can be rotated easily without the need for tools by a ‘screw head’ on the rear panel to give 60° x 60°, 90° x 40°, 120° x 40°, 120° x 60° (according to horns) HF coverage with the standard horn fitted. This increases the flexibility of the cabinet by allowing the HF horizontal dispersion to be ‘tuned’ for the given application. Primed for all touring applications, the ID24t (touring spec) features Speakon connectors and quick release rigging points for easy mounting – horizontally or vertically.

KEY FEATURES
