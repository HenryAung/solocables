The Soundcraft Signature 12MTK incorporate Soundcraft’s iconic Ghost mic preamps, directly drawn from the company’s top-of-the-line professional consoles, to deliver extraordinary audio quality with high headroom, wide dynamic range and exceptional resolution and clarity with a superb signal to noise ratio. They employ Soundcraft’s Sapphyre Assymetric EQ for perfectly equalizing every vocal and instrumental element in a mix with the unmistakable musicality inherent in every Soundcraft console, plus the GB Series audio routing technology famous in thousands of live venues worldwide. 

It includes a wide variety of built-in Lexicon studio-grade reverb, chorus, modulation and other effects and dbx limiters on the input channels. In addition, the console’s multi-track USB audio interface allows any VST/AU/AAX/TDM/RTAS plug-ins to be inserted on any input channel, enabling studio plug-ins to be seamlessly integrated with live performances. Accompanying the consoles are free downloads of the Lexicon MPXL native plug-in and Ableton Live 9 Lite. 

The console is designed to deliver pristine recordings. Both have an ultra-low-latency USB interface that flawlessly captures every channel, which can then be mixed or transferred to a DAW for further mixdown and production. The consoles offer XLR and switchable Hi-Z inputs that enable guitars, basses and other instruments to be directly connected. 

The Soundcraft Signature 12MTK features smooth, premium-quality faders with GB® Series audio routing with flexible pre/post switching on each Aux, and subgroups with powerful routing and switching options as well as dedicated outputs. 

Both the Soundcraft Signature 12MTK and Soundcraft Signature 22MTK are built using tour-grade robust metal construction and top-quality components. Both have an internal universal power supply.",,,,,,,

LD MAUI 28 - the compact, active and modular ""all-in-one"" system

The LD MAUI 28 (Multiple Array User Intuitive) is the perfect solution for musicians and DJs as well as presentations and events with sophisticated music playback.

Because no cables and stands are required, this “plug-and-play” system can be set up and taken down again very easily and quickly. Frequency-response-based 4.1 five-way amping results in a clear, dynamic and balanced sound throughout the frequency range of this system. The array configuration ensures greater coverage with very well-balanced sound distribution even in the farthest corners of the venue.

The MAUI 28, which combines PA and monitoring system in one, guarantees the same sound experience for both audience and musician. No disturbing speaker cables, no speaker stands, no transport issues, simply plug in the mixer and you're ready to go.
